My name is Onat Gungor. I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Computer Science and Engineering department at UC San Diego, advised by Professor [Tajana Rosing](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~trosing/). I have received my Ph.D. from UC San Diego and San Diego State University in December 2023. My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, security, and the Internet of Things. I am actively involved in several research centers including PRISM, COCOSYS, and TILOS; as well as collaborate with Intel Labs, and Lawrence Berkeley Lab on various research projects.
