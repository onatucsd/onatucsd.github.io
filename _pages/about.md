My name is Onat Gungor. I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Computer Science and Engineering department at UC San Diego, advised by Professor [Tajana Rosing](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~trosing/). I have received my Ph.D. from UC San Diego and San Diego State University in December 2023. My research lies at the intersection of security, machine learning, and the Internet of Things. I am actively involved in several research centers including [PRISM](https://prism.ucsd.edu/), [CoCoSys](https://cocosys.ece.gatech.edu/), and [TILOS](https://tilos.ai/); as well as collaborate with [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/ai.html) and [Lawrence Berkeley Lab](https://www.es.net/) on various research projects.
