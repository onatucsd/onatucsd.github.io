* Nilesh Prasad Pandey (PhD): Efficient Hybrid State Space Models; **Publication: GLSVLSI'25**
* Ye Tian (PhD): Multimodal Large Language Models and Physical World Comprehension; **Publication: SenSys'25, MASS'25**
* Sean Fuhrman (MS): Continual Novelty Detection for Network Intrusion Detection; **Publication: DAC'25**
* Ipek Kocal (MS): Resilient Time-series Classification Against Adversarial Attacks; **Publication: CSR'25, AI4TS'25**
* Abhilash Shankarampeta (MS): Adversarial Robustness of Multimodal Large Language Models 
* Jing Chen (BS): Dynamic Defense for ML-based IDS Against Adversarial Attacks; **Publication: SafeThings'25**
* Elvin Li, Charlie Shang (BS): Self-supervised Learning for Robust Intrusion Detection; **Publication: AICS'25**
* Harry Wang, Roshan Sood (BS): Adversarial Cybersecurity Question Answering via LLMs
