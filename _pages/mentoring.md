* Le Zhang (MS): Energy Efficient Edge Ensemble and Edge Cloud Collaboration; **Publications: SenSys'25, ASPDAC'25**
* Sean Fuhrman (MS): Continual Novelty Detection for Network Intrusion Detection; **Publication: DAC'25**
* Ipek Kocal (MS): Resilient Time-series Classification Against Adversarial Attacks; **Publication: AI4TS'25**
* Abhilash Shankarampeta (MS): Adversarial Robustness of Multimodal Large Language Models 
* Jing Chen (BS): Dynamic Defense for ML-based IDS Against Adversarial Attacks; **Publication: CSR'24**
* Elvin Li, Charlie Shang (BS): Self-supervised Learning for Robust Intrusion Detection; **Publication: AICS'25**
